                <p><strong>Untangle your mind&hellip;.!</strong></p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>I got a random text, a random day. This is what it said.</p>
                        <p>What followed when I heard her say that, were words of encouragement. Of course, what she had to say after is something that we all feel on the inside.</p>
                        <p>We are&nbsp;<strong>scared</strong>, we fear the possibility of&nbsp;<strong>judgement</strong>&nbsp;if we&nbsp;were to share our secrets with someone else. Hell, it might even be tough to open up sometimes. Even if not for all of these reasons, the thought of seeking help for your mind could be embarrassing, after all, If you seek professional help for your mind, there is definitely something irreversibly wrong with you, right?&nbsp;<strong>WRONG!</strong></p>
                        <p>Depression, anxiety and other mental health issues are illnesses that could get anyone. It is as normal as catching a cold, fever, or suffering from a heart disease.</p>
                        <p>Mental Health help gets a bad rep by default because of obvious reasons, if something is deemed wrong with you mentally, or even if you seek out for help, it could make people doubt your competency, your status. Since your mind makes you who you are, accepting you might need help with it also could make people think there is something fundamentally wrong with you. Society could finally bash you for being the oddball. So I do understand the hesitation, but the question is, are you willing to sacrifice your happiness and wellbeing for what the society may or may not end up thinking of you? Does your wellbeing and happiness weigh less than your worry of how people might&nbsp;<strong><em>look</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>at you?<br /> My answer? I&rsquo;d say lets re define how we&nbsp;<strong><em>look</em></strong>&nbsp;at it.</p>
                        <p>A subject matter expert is an individual with a deep understanding of an area.</p>
                        <p>In data analytics, professionals often rely on subject matter experts to validate their findings, businesses often rely on these subject matter experts to help them solve complex problems which bring in $. In a culture where we admire great businesses that racks up $ like crazy, my question is, why do we hesitate to apply the same strategy to our lives? Why not consider racking up all that peace to your mind? If big businesses with trillion-dollar evaluations don't shy away from seeking out a subject matter expert to help them out, why can&rsquo;t you for the sake of your happiness?</p>
                        <p>Even though with bad analogies, the point remains. There is no shame in seeking help, Instead, it&rsquo;s smart to seek help to cut your learning curve. Attacking a problem solo is commendable but when you find yourself back at where you started multiple times with the same misery, its time to ask yourself, time to reconsider. Once you do, give therapy a try and see what happens.</p>
                        <p>Mental health professionals are trained in human behavior and cognition. They see and observe much clearly than everyone else including yourself, and help bring clarity to your decisions and your life.</p>
                        <p>My friend is from Texas, I met her while she was touring India. Did you know the United States has about&nbsp;<strong>13</strong>&nbsp;psychiatrists per&nbsp;<strong>100,000</strong>&nbsp;people. With millennials and early Gen Zs, mental health awareness has seen rapid growth. The same cannot be said for India.</p>
                        <p>Here are some quick stats</p>
                        <p>A WHO report revealed<strong>&nbsp;7.5 percent</strong>&nbsp;of the Indian population suffered from some form of mental disorder, WHO also had predicted that this percentage would increase to&nbsp;<strong>20 percent</strong>&nbsp;by 2020. To cater to that big number India has around&nbsp;<strong>4000</strong>&nbsp;mental health professionals. To make matters worse, over 70 percent of people with mental health illnesses never seek out treatment.</p>
                        <p>Mental Health Research UK, found&nbsp;<strong>42 percent of the employees</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>India&rsquo;s corporate sector</strong>&nbsp;suffer from&nbsp;<strong>depression</strong>&nbsp;or an&nbsp;<strong>anxiety disorder</strong>. Almost every second employee. Well, let that sink in.</p>
                        <p>We hire a chef to cook for us at times, an electrician to help with our electrical equipment, a doctor for issues with our health, so why not consider a Mental health professional who could help you sort out your tangled mind.</p>
                        <p>It's paramount we changed the state of mental health. All it takes is for you to be kind to yourself and others. Seek out help if you need it, encourage others to do the same.</p>

You&rsquo;re curled up in a corner almost feeling numb, with many butterflies in y<span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm"><span id="rmm">o</span></span></span></span>ur stomach and a faint feeling in your heart racing like you&rsquo;re just about to miss a very important flight, wondering why life is like this? You gather up the courage to finally admit to yourself &ldquo;maybe I should talk to someone&rdquo; and with that realization comes a feeling of hope that things will go uphill from here. &ldquo; I&rsquo;ve identified what my problem is now all I&rsquo;ve got to do is work on it and I&rsquo;ll feel okay in no time&rdquo; but only if it were that easy. Finding help for mental challenges is not as get a prescription for the flu. It&rsquo;s much more complicated than that.</p>
                <p id="552f" class="id ie gs if b ig ix ih ii ij iy ik il im iz in io ip ja iq ir is jb it iu iw cw eu" data-selectable-paragraph="">Realization of the fact that you might need help doesn't bring you the calm and composure that one might assume it would. When you are alone with yourself and realize you need help, a wave of positivity doesn't brush you ashore, but the tide of reality carries you away and you&rsquo;re surrounded by the storm. Trying to stay afloat but feeling so alone and helpless waiting and wishing for a boatman to hold and tell you &ldquo; Hey, I&rsquo;ve got you. You're safe now&rdquo; Telling people around you doesn&rsquo;t bring you to support that you thought it would, it just keeps making it real and real until it scares you numb. Everything you&rsquo;re trying just doesn't seem to help because it just keeps getting real and harder every time you talk about it. It pushes you down a rabbit hole and it keeps difficult as each day passes. You see people around you trying to help but it doesn't bring you the calm the boatman did so you keep doubting yourself and push your loved ones away.</p>

Hope and diligence are the only things that are going to help you get through this. Choosing to get out of it is the only way to deal with it. The need and want to get better has to come from within to give you the perseverance to face the day. It seems hard which it is, but it gets easier. It gets easier every day but for that, you have to do it every day.</p>

            <ol>
            <li><strong>Help them seek treatment.</strong><br /> When someone has anxiety menial tasks like looking and seeing out for help and support can be severely challenging for them.

            <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t try to fix them</strong><strong><br /> </strong>Try to be mindful and give them as much space as possible at this time. Be kind to them and be patient.

            <li><strong>Set healthy boundaries and expectations</strong><strong><br /> </strong>Although you might want to be at hand for them whenever they might need you, setting boundaries for you and them can be extremely beneficial as it helps you realize what and how much you can do for them. Setting expectations play a similar role by specifying what basic needs of your you need your partner to fulfill to help you gain bandwidth to support them and avoiding feeling neglected</li>
            <li><strong>Be open to learning</strong><strong><br /> </strong>Always be more keen and interested in learning more about your partner&rsquo;s situation. Research, talk to doctors and gain more insights about they&rsquo;re health. Everyone has a different approach that works for them, learn what works for you and your partner.
