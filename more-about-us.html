        <h2 class="mt-5">About us (Draft to be improved on) </h2>
        <h5 class="mt-3 mb-5"> 

            We started off as a mental health community with dedicated listeners for people. After a bit we realised how insufficient the mental health infrastructure is and that’s how Align came to be. <br> 
            
            Align is our solution to enable mental health infrastructure and the well being of the community <br>
            A three pronged approach is what we have come up with.  <br>
            
            1) Awareness and Support <br>
               Making people aware of everything Mental Health. We leverage Marketing (Digital campaigns, content creation, digital marketing(mention other roles) and different medium to educate people). We are actively working on creating a community of safe and strong space for people to educate themselves and find support. <br>
            
            2)  Mental Health Professionals <br>
            
             We work with Mental Health Professionals and empower them, we provide them with solutions related to their online infrastructure, smoothing their access to patients and growing their business, Mental Health Analytics, Help create an online directory of professional written blogs for professionals to explore and educate from their senior counterparts etc. (if you are a mental health professional click here)<br> 
            
            3) Promoting Creativity <br>
            
            There is growing evidence of how much engaging and creating your own works help lower nurosis related to meaninglessness. We work with people engaged in content creation (Music, Art, Writing etc) to promote the relevance of these activities in daily lives. If you are engaged in any kind of creative activity and want to work with us, click here.<br> 
            
             
            
            This three pronged approach is how are foraging into mental health space, It also means we most often always have space for new people who share our goal, so if you are one of them and want to join us, feel free to send us your request<br>  </h5>
