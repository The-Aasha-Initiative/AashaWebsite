<p><strong>What happens after you decide you need help?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those days. You&rsquo;re curled up in a corner almost feeling numb, with many butterflies in your stomach and a faint feeling in your heart racing like you&rsquo;re just about to miss a very important flight, wondering why life is like this? You gather up the courage to finally admit to yourself &ldquo;maybe I should talk to someone&rdquo; and with that realization comes a feeling of hope that things will go uphill from here. &ldquo; I&rsquo;ve identified what my problem is now all I&rsquo;ve got to do is work on it and I&rsquo;ll feel okay in no time&rdquo; but only if it were that easy. Finding help for mental challenges is not as get a prescription for the flu. It&rsquo;s much more complicated than that.</p>
<p>Realization of the fact that you might need help doesn't bring you the calm and composure that one might assume it would. When you are alone with yourself and realize you need help, a wave of positivity doesn't brush you ashore, but the tide of reality carries you away and you&rsquo;re surrounded by the storm. Trying to stay afloat but feeling so alone and helpless waiting and wishing for a boatman to hold and tell you &ldquo; Hey, I&rsquo;ve got you. You're safe now&rdquo; Telling people around you doesn&rsquo;t bring you to support that you thought it would, it just keeps making it real and real until it scares you numb. Everything you&rsquo;re trying just doesn't seem to help because it just keeps getting real and harder every time you talk about it. It pushes you down a rabbit hole and it keeps difficult as each day passes. You see people around you trying to help but it doesn't bring you the calm the boatman did so you keep doubting yourself and push your loved ones away.</p>
<p>But you have to be certain not to give up because that's when your progress starts. Hope and diligence are the only things that are going to help you get through this. Choosing to get out of it is the only way to deal with it. The need and want to get better has to come from within to give you the perseverance to face the day. It seems hard which it is, but it gets easier. It gets easier every day but for that, you have to do it every day.</p>
<p>Opening yourself up in front of your therapist can be one of the most challenging parts of the process, exposing your vulnerabilities to a stranger is one of the hardest parts of seeking help. But you have to remember that therapy is a two-way process, no one can help you until you help yourself and that realization can help make all the difference.</p>
