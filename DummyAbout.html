                    Being in the public eye, I know that it might feel a little frightening to contact a therapist.

                    Asking for help is not the easiest thing to do - so I make the therapy as easy as possible for you.  
                </p>

                </p>

                </strong>
                </p> 

                <p>

                <p>  
                    Let me show you how to embrace your own self-worth and accept all that life brings to make you happy.   
                </p> 
                
                <p> 
                    Having lost my father at a very young age and on the brink of the poverty line.
                    I worked endlessly to better my circumstances. 
                    I studied, became successful and was happily married.
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    After trying to conceive for a few years, we embarked on the IVF journey. 
                    After several failed attempts and miscarriages, this invasive journey led us nowhere. It ultimately resulted in our ten-year marriage breaking down. 
                </p>  
                
                <p>
                    At that time, in that painful place, I decided to focus on my personal development and changed my career path, grasping this point as an opportunity to reboot my life and start again.
                </p>   
                
                <p>
                    As a result of my own difficult journey, I know now that my purpose is to raise vibrations and give all my love, joy and positive energy. I'm passionate about helping people with their mental and emotional wellbeing 
                </p>   
                
                <p>
                    I can assist people who suffer from Stress, Anxiety and Depression. I can help individuals free themselves from addiction, self-sabotage, unexplained infertility, weight issues. 
                </p>
                   
                <p>
                    I can help liberate you from other problems, both physical and emotional, that are causing you to be unhappy, unsatisfied, distressed or panicky.
                </p>    

                <p>    
                    I'm thankful because I could not ask for a more rewarding career. <strong><em>I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to transform people from all walks of life</em></strong> so that they can feel their own sense of freedom, purpose, happiness and most of all peace of mind. 
                </p>  

                <p>
                    All of the treatments are designed for an individual's own, personal needs. This means it's impossible to state a 'One-price-fits-all' as that's not how real human beings work!
